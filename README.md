# `bitnami/minideb-extras`

## TL;DR

```dockerfile
FROM bitnami/minideb-extras:jessie
```

## About

The `bitnami/minideb-extras` image is a customized base image for use in Bitnami container images and is built on top of the light-weight and Debian-based `bitnami/minideb` image. Learn more about [bitnami/minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) in [Minideb: A New Container Base Image](https://engineering.bitnami.com/2016/11/02/minideb-a-new-container-base-image.html).

The `Dockerfile` installs [Nami](https://github.com/bitnami/nami) and includes a `bitnami-pkg` helper script to simplify downloading of Nami modules from the Bitnami package repositories. Additionally the `Dockerfile` installs [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini)  and is used in the default [entrypoint](../../blob/master/rootfs/entrypoint.sh).

## Variants

The image is available in the following variants:

|                  Image                   |                    Configuration                    |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| bitnami/minideb-extras:jessie            | Standard                                            |
| bitnami/minideb-extras:stretch           | Standard                                            |
| bitnami/minideb-extras:jessie-buildpack  | Buildpack (includes `build-essential`, `git`, etc.) |
| bitnami/minideb-extras:stretch-buildpack | Buildpack (includes `build-essential`, `git`, etc.) |

## Usage

Use like a regular base image.

The following example uses the `install_packages` helper script, provided by `minideb`, to install APT packages from the Debian repositories. The `bitnami-pkg` tool to install `nami` packages published by Bitnami.

```dockerfile
FROM bitnami/minideb-extras:jessie
ENV BITNAMI_APP_NAME=apache
RUN install_packages libssl1.0.0 libaprutil1 libapr1 libc6 libuuid1 libexpat1 \
      libpcre3 libldap-2.4-2 libsasl2-2 libgnutls-deb0-28 zlib1g libp11-kit0 \
      libtasn1-6 libnettle4 libhogweed2 libgmp10 libffi6
RUN bitnami-pkg install apache-2.4.25-0
CMD ["nami", "start", "--foreground", "apache"]
```

## Configuration Parameters

The following tables lists the configurable parameters of the image.

|         Parameter         |                       Description                       |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `BASH_DEBUG`              | [Turn on bash debugging](#turn-on-bash-debugging)       |
| `NAMI_DEBUG`              | [Turn on nami debugging](#turn-on-nami-debugging)       |
| `DISABLE_WELCOME_MESSAGE` | [Turn off the welcome text](#turn-off-the-welcome-text) |

### Turn on BASH debugging

Add `BASH_DEBUG=1` to the container environment to enable [BASH debugging](http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/debuggingtips#use_shell_debug_output) which prints the commands being executed.

### Turn on Nami debugging

To enable debugging add `NAMI_DEBUG=1` to the container environment. The `NAMI_DEBUG` variable enables helpful logging and debugging features which can be valuable for debugging issues.

### Turn off the welcome text

When a new container is launched, a welcome message is displayed as illustrated below:

```console
 *** Welcome to the apache image ***
 *** Brought to you by Bitnami ***
 *** More information: https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-apache ***
 *** Issues: https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-apache/issues ***
```

Adding `DISABLE_WELCOME_MESSAGE=1` to the container environment turns off this message.
